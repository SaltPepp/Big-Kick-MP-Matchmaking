# Big Kick Multiplayer Matchmaking
Researching to develop a fast player matchmaking solution. This is just a project for fun. I did create a matchmaking system many months ago but it was very dirty because I used arrays when I should of used lists. Now that I learnt lists in C#, I'm starting this system from scratch. Its unfortunate that I lost the old system code also from not backing it up. The old system had linear search algorithm but I'm going to use bineary search algorithm in this system unless I can find a faster searching algorithm. The idea is to implement the best searching algorithm for huge increase in searching speed. This system is not being built for a game but it could serve as a prototype system in the future in a game. I doubt it though as I don't think this system will be that good as I'm not very efficient c# programmer.

This multiplayer matchmaking system is being designed for a shooter genre.

This system should cater for:
  - Partys of unlimited people before searching.
  - Unlimited player slots with each server can have different player cap. This means every lobby can be a different player cap
  - Unlimited servers.
  - Team creation
