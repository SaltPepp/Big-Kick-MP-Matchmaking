# Big-Kick-MP-Matchmaking
Researching to develop a fast player matchmaking solution. This is just a project for fun. I did create a matchmaking system many months ago but it was very dirty because I used arrays when I should of used lists. Now that I learnt lists in C#, I'm starting this system from scratch. Its unfortunate that I lost the old system code also from not backing it up. The old system had linear search algorithm but I'm going to use bineary search algorithm in this system unless I can find a faster searching algorithm. The idea is to implement the best searching algorithm for huge increase in searching speed.
